# Cultural Victory Conditions

Here places the list of objectives each faction has to achieve to obtain a cultural victory. These objective are 
selected according to the race, which means all factions in the same race have the same cultural objectives. In
addition, only standard factions are going to have this kind of victory, which means it is not going to be available
for horde factions.

The objectives are based on the following pattern: Own 30 provinces, research an 80% of your technology tree and
maintain at least 51% of your religion in your owned provinces. In the case of different technology tree inside of the 
same race (Repanse of Wulfhart), the smaller tree has been used as base.
