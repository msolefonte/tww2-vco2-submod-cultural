# Cultural Victory Submod for VCO2

[Steam Workshop Mod Link](#)

Victory Conditions Overhaul 2 - Cultural Victory Submod mod for Total War: Warhammer 2.

## Introduction

This mod introduces a major redone of the victory conditions of Total War: Warhammer II Mortal Empires campaign. A lot 
of members of the community, including me, think that there is a poor job done in the default ones. This results in 
abandoned campaigns and poor differences between factions, which usually feel all the same in a lot of races.

This optional mod brings back the Cultural Victory.

## Introduced changes

You can check the new victory conditions in the [Introduced changes](docs/README.md) file.
